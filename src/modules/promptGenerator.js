/**
 * ============================================================
 * PROMPT GENERATOR v2 — Start/End Frame Architecture
 * ============================================================
 * 
 * THAY ĐỔI LỚN so với v1:
 * - Mỗi pose output 2 prompt: START FRAME + END FRAME
 * - Start = tư thế chuẩn bị / bắt đầu chuyển động
 * - End   = tư thế hoàn thành / giữ (hold position)
 * - Dùng cho video: interpolate giữa 2 frame → animation mượt
 * 
 * Output hiện tại bao gồm startFrame, endFrame và videoPrompt (dành cho Veo 3 hoặc AI Video Generator khác)
 * 
 * OUTPUT PER SCENE:
 * {
 *   sceneName: "Cat Cow",
 *   startFrame: { ... },
 *   endFrame: { ... },
 *   videoPrompt: "A 3D cartoon girl on a purple yoga mat. Action: The character starts by... Then, seamlessly... and holds..."
 * }
 * 
 * TẠI SAO CẦN 2 FRAME?
 * ┌────────────────┐        ┌────────────────┐
 * │  START FRAME   │───────▶│   END FRAME    │
 * │                │  video │                │
 * │  Tư thế bắt   │  tween │  Tư thế hoàn   │
 * │  đầu / chuẩn  │        │  thành / giữ   │
 * │  bị           │        │                │
 * └────────────────┘        └────────────────┘
 * 
 * Ví dụ: "Standing Forward Fold"
 *   Start: Đứng thẳng (Mountain Pose)
 *   End:   Gập người về phía trước, đầu cúi xuống
